# plugin.video.lrt.lt 
This Kodi plugin provides streams live channels from the Lithuanian national broadcaster LRT.LT.

## Description
This is the first Kodi plugin I've created, I orignally used kodi.plugin.lrt-mediateka, but this stopped working and hasn't been updated for some time, so I decided to try to create my own from scratch. In future I plan to create a plugin for all Lithuanian channels when free time permits.

## Getting Started
### Dependencies
parse_qsl, xbmcgui, xbmcplugin,requests, xbmcaddon & xbmcvfs

### Installing
Download the zip file and install through the Kodi interface
